Student's Dropout Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers
A Data science project on Predicting Students' dropout using Machine Learning classification models

Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using machine learning classification algorithms to identify students who are likely to drop out. By leveraging data on student demographics, academic performance, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables, the aim is to build a robust predictive model that can effectively forecast the likelihood of students dropping out.

The data gathered are from both internal and external sources, pulling information from different institutions. This data was drawn from various databases within universities and colleges. It covers student records spanning from the academic year 2008/2009 to 2018/2019.

This model can then be used by educational institutions to allocate resources, implement early intervention strategies, and support at-risk students.

Problem
In today's educational landscape, student retention and success are of utmost importance for educational institutions. Identifying students who are at risk of dropping out and implementing timely interventions can greatly contribute to improving graduation rates and ensuring academic success. What are certain factors that may affect students' retention or dropout in academic institutions?

The methodology adopted during the course of this project includes:

Data collected through Kaggle datasets.
Data processing and descriptive analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis using Python visualization tools to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends.
Predictive analysis using Machine Learning Classification algorithms.
Dependencies
Data Wrangling and processing Libraries
Pandas
Numpy
Visualization Libraries
Matplotlib
Plotly express
Plotly Graph Objects
Machine Learning Libraries
Scikit Learn
Deliverables
Comprehensive Jupyter notebooks containing codes and results
Findings/Results
Through analysis, it is deduced that two factors are to be considered when predicting the student's retention/dropout (not limited to):

Age at enrollment
Course Others that showed significance are:
Tuition fees up to date
1st and 2nd Semester performance
Application mode
Out of five classification algorithms, the classifier that performed best after several tries was Decision Tree with an 83% accuracy and 0.78 AUC score
